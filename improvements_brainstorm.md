Hardware Simulator:
1. Click app icon to open software (not have to use terminal)
    (I'm currently able to find the executable in my file system and double click to run windows batch file) (mine doesnt:/ )
2. Can edit text in the app (not have to use text editor)
3. Make UI scale for 4k and full screen
4. Do not need to import testing code in software
5. Drag and drop hardware chips instead of code
6. Make it where you can read the full error
7. Make the project progression more clear (ie. Has students complete steps within the software rather than having to constantly consult textbook for what chip to implement next)
8. Make 3a tests faster
9. Tutorial when first pulling up software 
  (We need an ability to skip or remember it's been completed)

Assembler:
1. Show all differences rather than only first

CPU Emulator:
1. Make interface simpler
2. Test scripts do not have to be imported
3. Visualize PC better (maybe with arrow?)
4. Make tests faster

General:
1. These chip descriptions blow on chapter 5
