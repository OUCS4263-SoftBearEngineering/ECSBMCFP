This file is for problems with the programs and potential fixes/improvemnets you may come across while working on the projects and such.

* Fix 4k/resizeable issues
* Make testing multiple files at once easier
* In-app file editing?
* Dark theme
* Retain selected items for drop downs and other previously selected test files
* Have the option to look at multiple views at once. (the view as in the screen, output, comparision, etc)
* combine all these different programs into one so we dont have to open a bunch of programs
* Noticed that the CPU emulator runs WAY faster when testing if the program isnt the active window while it tests, maybe see if we can get that speed all the time?
*
