# ECSBMCFP (The Elements of a Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer From First Principles)


## IN Progress: Ajax Swing
Attempt to convert a fully based Java codebase GUI application into a browser to be accessed by all devices. This would solve accessibility problems such as viewing the sotware on mutiple devices. The AJAX converts the gui into and HTML form, which attempts to mimic the gui based settings, but it also may need tweaks to get the layout conversion to correctly convert. We then would need to tweak the design to fit our improved UI design.
## In Progress: GWT
Create Browser based applications from a java code base.
Complications: The conversion to GWT requires all widgets to be replaced with GWT compatable widgets. This is a very labor intensive process and not guranteed to work after all the tweaks and changes are made. Due to the nature of the short time schedule, we are going to pursue alternatives.

## Communications:
### Notion
Team based tool to assign individual work and allow each member to communicate their progress or request assistance.

### Microsoft Teams
Plan meeting times, share files, and dicuss asynchonously

### Zoom
Virtual meetings to dicuss progress on the project. Share screens and chat logs to record information.

## Failed: JCLA
Microsoft supported program to convert a bulk of Java code into C#. It was run on Windows 2003 Operating System. This program was discontinued and not supported again by Microsoft in later versions or by the community; therefore, we couln't utilize it.
## Failed: IKVM
An implementation of Java Mono for Microsefot.NET frameworks. It is a Java virtual machine created in .NET. It was a framework to convert java to a .NET gui using the tools within the device. The software is no longer compatable and serviced; therefore, we cannot use it for our implementation.
## Failed: Sharpen
Open source software to convern Java code to C#. It required Java 7 and Maven, where our Java program is supported by Java 8. Thus we could not convert the data properly.
## Failed: Asp.net
A web framework to utilize the frontend languages seamless displaying of our program. It allows compatibility between HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It requires a C# code for it to work properly. So we must convert our java program to C#. This idea was fropped after the three above failed attempts to convert Java to C#.
## Failed: Vue.js
## Failed: React
