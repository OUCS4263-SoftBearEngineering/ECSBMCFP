## Current Deployment

## Original Deployment
Since this is a software to improve the excercise tools within textbook: "Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles," I will go over the previous deployment to compare our improvements.

1) Visit [Nand2Textis.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and download the textbook for the excercise problems.

2) Visit the "Software Tab" and install the Nand2Textris software. Depending on the operating system, follow the setup guidelines provided on the website. For Windows, ensure the proper JRE is installed.

3) Once the sofware is extracted into your file system, navigate to the nand2tetris source location. You will now to able to launch the individual siumulators. Each simulator is a separate executable, so depending on the chapter excercise will affect which simulator is run.

4) Focusing on the Hardware simulator, once running, one must upload the test file. Then they must upload their own code snippit from a text file. This is important because all these siumlators do not provide text editing within the application. A major overhaul that we implemented. The worst part about the application involved having to open a text file or editor to make a small change, then having to re-upload the file into the simulator, then re-uploading the proper test file.
