Unit Testing:

System Testing:

Acceptance Testing:

Rough Draft:
Unit Testing - Unit testing will be performed on each Hardware chip as they are completed and integrated into the main program. We will run expected and potential inputs to each chip to make sure the correct results and being given for each chip
system testing - once all chips are properly tested and integrated we can test the systems overall functionality by testing that the chips and user interface interact appropriatly. For example, if we connect two chips via our UI and give them an input we will verify that we get the correct output.
acceptance testing - We plan to perform acceptence testing by reworking through the homeworks and assignments once again after the majority of implementation is done, since we have all already completly these assignments on the previous version of the software we have a base understanding of how the program should function.
